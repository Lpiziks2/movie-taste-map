# Movie Taste Map

Hybrid movie recommendation system combining LSH, K-Means clustering, and collaborative filtering. 

Built for DTU course 02807 (Computational Tools for Data Science).

Group 8

## Approach

- **LSH** - finds similar movies using feature overlap (cast, genre, director)
- **Clustering** - groups movies semantically using SBERT embeddings
- **Collaborative filtering** - predicts ratings based on user behavior

The system adapts its weighting based on how much rating data is available for each user.

## Dataset
